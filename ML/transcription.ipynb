one.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000\\nSo I've never done a video like this before.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000\\nI've always got suggested this.\\n\\n5\\n00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000\\nBut, like, I just didn't know if I really wanted to do it or not.\\n\\n6\\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000\\nToday, we're going to be vlogging for 15 minutes straight.\\n\\n7\\n00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000\\nWithout any cuts.\\n\\n8\\n00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000\\nOh, this could go very wrong.\\n\\n9\\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000\\nAnyway, I'm over at my parents' house right now.\\n\\n10\\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000\\nLet's go inside and see what's up with everybody.\\n\\n11\\n00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000\\nOh yeah, not only is there no cuts, but there's, like, no edits either.\\n\\n12\\n00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000\\nThis is just, like, the rawest form of video I have ever posted in my life.\\n\\n13\\n00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000\\nBut

there?\\n\\n35\\n00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000\\nWow.\\n\\n36\\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000\\nYou paid that specific bill?\\n\\n37\\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000\\nYeah.\\n\\n38\\n00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000\\nOh, gosh.\\n\\n39\\n00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000\\nWe're all goofs in here.\\n\\n40\\n00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000\\nMissing bulbs.\\n\\n41\\n00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n42\\n00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000\\nGirl, they're all in.\\n\\n43\\n00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000\\nYeah, there was never.\\n\\n44\\n00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000\\nI'm so confused.\\n\\n45\\n00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000\\nWe're so confused.\\n\\n46\\n00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000\\nThere was bulbs missing earlier.\\n\\n47\\n00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000\\nThere was not.\\n\\n48\\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000\\nYes, there was.\\n\\n49\\n00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000\\nWe had bulbs yesterday.\\n\\n50\\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000\\nIt was done.\\n\\n51\\n00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000\\nIt was not.\\n\\n52\\n00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000\\nYou're a liar.\\n\\n53\\n00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000\\nHello.\\n\\n54\\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000\\nHi.\\n\\n55\\n00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000\\nHi.\\n\\n56\\n00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000\\nOh, you're not answering that?\\n\\n57\\n00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000\\nNo, we got the 15 minutes of vlog.\\n\\n58\\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000\\nWhat do we have?\\n\\n59\\n00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000\\nWe have two minutes, people.\\n\\n60\\n00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000\\nThis is interesting.\\n\\n61\\n00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000\\nYou know what's really weird?\\n\\n62\\n00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000\\nI used to vlog all the time with absolutely no cuts.\\n\\n63\\n00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000\\nOh my gosh.\\n\\n64\\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n65\\n00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000\\nDid you throw something at me?\\n\\n66\\n00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000\\nYes, you did me.\\n\\n67\\n00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000\\nAsshole.\\n\\n68\\n00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000\\nWhat happened?\\n\\n69\\n00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000\\nWhat is it?\\n\\n70\\n00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000\\nHe threw something over the boat.\\n\\n71\\n00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000\\nWhat did you throw at me?\\n\\n72\\n00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000\\nYou're an asshole.\\n\\n73\\n00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000\\nCome on, I'm trying to find furniture.\\n\\n74\\n00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000\\nWhat are you getting now?\\n\\n75\\n00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000\\nIt's not big enough.\\n\\n76\\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000\\nOh, my mom is sending her couch back because it's not big enough.\\n\\n77\\n00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000\\nI can just take it off your hands if you want.\\n\\n78\\n00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000\\nHere, you want a boner?\\n\\n79\\n00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n80\\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000\\nYou want to buy something?\\n\\n81\\n00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000\\nHow much is it?\\n\\n82\\n00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000\\nThree.\\n\\n83\\n00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000\\nThree?\\n\\n84\\n00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000\\nThree dollars?\\n\\n85\\n00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000\\nI'm down.\\n\\n86\\n00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000\\nObviously, it's more than that.\\n\\n87\\n00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000\\nIt would look nicer in your place.\\n\\n88\\n00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000\\nIt would.\\n\\n89\\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000\\nI think it'll look really nice in that room that we have no furniture in now.\\n\\n90\\n00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000\\nI think it's phenomenal.\\n\\n91\\n00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n92\\n00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000\\nI don't get it.\\n\\n93\\n00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000\\nI don't know.\\n\\n94\\n00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000\\nI'm not really making any money right now.\\n\\n95\\n00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000\\nI got to relax on the spending.\\n\\n96\\n00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000\\nI'm going to let you go on.\\n\\n97\\n00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000\\nI spent a lot of money.\\n\\n98\\n00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000\\nI said you let her go on.\\n\\n99\\n00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000\\nI just paid the electric.\\n\\n100\\n00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000\\nI just can't cut.\\n\\n101\\n00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000\\nNo, we can't.\\n\\n102\\n00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000\\nNo cuts today.\\n\\n103\\n00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000\\nWhat are you doing?\\n\\n104\\n00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000\\nThis video is totally out of focus right now.\\n\\n105\\n00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000\\nI apologize, guys.\\n\\n106\\n00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000\\nThere's this setting on my camera, and if I tap the screen, it goes completely out of focus.\\n\\n107\\n00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000\\nObviously, I can't cut this.\\n\\n108\\n00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000\\nI can't really restart or fix it.\\n\\n109\\n00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000\\nWe're going to have to deal with a little bit of blurriness.\\n\\n110\\n00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000\\nI'm trying to fix it, though, if I can center it.\\n\\n111\\n00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000\\nI need a motorcycle fairing for my bike.\\n\\n112\\n00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000\\nA what?\\n\\n113\\n00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000\\nA motorcycle fairing on my bike.\\n\\n114\\n00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000\\nWhat is a fairing?\\n\\n115\\n00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n116\\n00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000\\nWhat are you saying?\\n\\n117\\n00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000\\nSay what?\\n\\n118\\n00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n119\\n00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000\\nFairing.\\n\\n120\\n00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000\\nWhat did you just say?\\n\\n121\\n00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000\\nMotorcycle fairing.\\n\\n122\\n00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000\\nFairing?\\n\\n123\\n00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000\\nWhat did you say?\\n\\n124\\n00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000\\nFairing?\\n\\n125\\n00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000\\nWhat is this word?\\n\\n126\\n00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000\\nIt's a windshield, a fairing.\\n\\n127\\n00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000\\nOh, fairing.\\n\\n128\\n00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000\\nI still don't know what that is.\\n\\n129\\n00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000\\nGio.\\n\\n130\\n00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000\\nGio, you want to be in the vlog?\\n\\n131\\n00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000\\nYou want to be in the vlog?\\n\\n132\\n00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n133\\n00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000\\nWhat do you want?\\n\\n134\\n00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000\\nWhat do you want?\\n\\n135\\n00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000\\nHe wants a treat, don't you?\\n\\n136\\n00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000\\nIs that what you want?\\n\\n137\\n00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000\\nOh, yeah, he's going to the closet.\\n\\n138\\n00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000\\nAll right, this dog is the pickiest dog ever.\\n\\n139\\n00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000\\nWatch this, okay?\\n\\n140\\n00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000\\nWhat kind of treat do you want, Gio?\\n\\n141\\n00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000\\nWe got...\\n\\n142\\n00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000\\nHe'll never accept any of these treats.\\n\\n143\\n00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000\\nHe's so picky.\\n\\n144\\n00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000\\nCome here.\\n\\n145\\n00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000\\nYou want this?\\n\\n146\\n00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000\\nLook, he'll smell it, and he won't take it.\\n\\n147\\n00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000\\nSee?\\n\\n148\\n00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000\\nWhat is he doing?\\n\\n149\\n00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000\\nHe'll do that with every single treat.\\n\\n150\\n00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000\\nWe've learned a trick.\\n\\n151\\n00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000\\nJust give him a treat, and if he doesn't accept it, just leave it there.\\n\\n152\\n00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000\\nHe'll eventually come back and take it.\\n\\n153\\n00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000\\nOoh, what do we got over here?\\n\\n154\\n00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000\\nIs this brownies?\\n\\n155\\n00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000\\nOh, that's not a brownie.\\n\\n156\\n00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000\\nRibs.\\n\\n157\\n00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000\\nI don't know why I thought that looked like a brownie.\\n\\n158\\n00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000\\nThat's not brownies.\\n\\n159\\n00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000\\nThat's meat.\\n\\n160\\n00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000\\nSome chicken.\\n\\n161\\n00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000\\nOoh.\\n\\n162\\n00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000\\nHuh?\\n\\n163\\n00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000\\nGio, what do you think?\\n\\n164\\n00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000\\nBlack leather.\\n\\n165\\n00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000\\nBlack leather?\\n\\n166\\n00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000\\nI'm so upset because, like, this actually looks so nice,\\n\\n167\\n00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000\\nand it feels so comfy, too.\\n\\n168\\n00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000\\nIt's velvet.\\n\\n169\\n00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000\\nHere's my issue.\\n\\n170\\n00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000\\nIn order for me to get the extensions,\\n\\n171\\n00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000\\nI have to send the whole thing back and order it.\\n\\n172\\n00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000\\nThey won't just send me the replacement parts, which would be so easier.\\n\\n173\\n00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000\\nYeah.\\n\\n174\\n00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000\\nYou believe that?\\n\\n175\\n00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000\\nIt's only two pieces, single pieces, and they won't send it to me.\\n\\n176\\n00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000\\nThat's weird.\\n\\n177\\n00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000\\nDad won't send my stuff to your house, babe.\\n\\n178\\n00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000\\nI know.\\n\\n179\\n00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000\\nI just keep insisting on me getting it over there.\\n\\n180\\n00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000\\nWhat are you going to do with all your friends to take it over?\\n\\n181\\n00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000\\nWell, Grandma, how about you move into my house?\\n\\n182\\n00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000\\nNo, I'm fine with where I'm at today.\\n\\n183\\n00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000\\nGrandma don't want to come over there.\\n\\n184\\n00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000\\nYou guys know why.\\n\\n185\\n00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000\\nGrandma's going to constantly be getting, I guess,\\n\\n186\\n00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000\\nthe word to use is harassed by me every day.\\n\\n187\\n00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000\\nShe's got it made right now.\\n\\n188\\n00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000\\nI know.\\n\\n189\\n00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000\\nShe sits in that room.\\n\\n190\\n00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000\\nActually, nobody bothers me over there.\\n\\n191\\n00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000\\nI have to put up with you shenanigans.\\n\\n192\\n00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000\\nI know.\\n\\n193\\n00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000\\nAt least you can lock the door over here, and you don't got to hear me at all.\\n\\n194\\n00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000\\nYou got to put up with the me-heads.\\n\\n195\\n00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000\\nThe me-heads.\\n\\n196\\n00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000\\nI have to beat somebody the fuck up.\\n\\n197\\n00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000\\nMom, we're family friendly.\\n\\n198\\n00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000\\nYeah, this video is not family friendly at all.\\n\\n199\\n00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000\\nWe're more than that.\\n\\n200\\n00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000\\nI only curse one time.\\n\\n201\\n00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000\\nWe're beyond family friendly.\\n\\n202\\n00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000\\nWell, I don't know.\\n\\n203\\n00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000\\nIt is what it is.\\n\\n204\\n00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000\\nBut it will look nice over here, mate.\\n\\n205\\n00:06:39,000 -->

couch.\\n\\n249\\n00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000\\nI didn't confirm or deny.\\n\\n250\\n00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000\\nYes, you did.\\n\\n251\\n00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000\\nYou almost did.\\n\\n252\\n00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000\\nI almost did.\\n\\n253\\n00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000\\nSomebody power in.\\n\\n254\\n00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000\\nJust order a different one.\\n\\n255\\n00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000\\nYeah, somebody can send what she needs.\\n\\n256\\n00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000\\nLook, we're in the couch.\\n\\n257\\n00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000\\nYou got to cover it already.\\n\\n258\\n00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000\\nWell, we'll cover it because the dog lays on it.\\n\\n259\\n00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000\\nYeah, we don't.\\n\\n260\\n00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000\\nThink of your mother.\\n\\n261\\n00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000\\nHuh?\\n\\n262\\n00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000\\nThink of your mother.\\n\\n263\\n00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000\\nWhat about my mother?\\n\\n264\\n00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000\\nI don't want to pay for it.\\n\\n265\\n00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000\\nGrandma, I'm not cheap.\\n\\n266\\n00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000\\nI'm being smart with my money.\\n\\n267\\n00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000\\nHence, why I haven't been buying anything lately.\\n\\n268\\n00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000\\nLike, literally, the most amount of money I spent this month has been on food for the\\n\\n269\\n00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000\\npast couple months, I'd say.\\n\\n270\\n00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000\\nI have to say, I'm proud of you.\\n\\n271\\n00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000\\nYou really did well the last two months.\\n\\n272\\n00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000\\nYou spent less money in the last two months than I think in the last five years, like\\n\\n273\\n00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000\\never, on one month period.\\n\\n274\\n00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000\\nThere were times you were spending...\\n\\n275\\n00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000\\nA little too much.\\n\\n276\\n00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000\\nDouble.\\n\\n277\\n00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000\\nLike, you were spending like...\\n\\n278\\n00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000\\nDouble.\\n\\n279\\n00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000\\nNo, like, even more than that.\\n\\n280\\n00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000\\nI was probably 10, 20 times that.\\n\\n281\\n00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000\\nYeah, I've been very cautious with my spending lately.\\n\\n282\\n00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000\\nJust trying to...\\n\\n283\\n00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000\\nI mean, look, there's no need to spend ridiculous amounts of money.\\n\\n284\\n00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000\\nI'm just saving it.\\n\\n285\\n00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000\\nAnd, you know, one day when I retire, I'll have my money and that's it.\\n\\n286\\n00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000\\nAlways save for a rainy day.\\n\\n287\\n00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000\\nYes.\\n\\n288\\n00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000\\nThat's something I've always been good at, honestly.\\n\\n289\\n00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000\\nEven when I was a little kid, Mom, right?\\n\\n290\\n00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000\\nI would always save my money.\\n\\n291\\n00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000\\nAnd Sabrina would always spend her money.\\n\\n292\\n00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000\\nAnd I would save it.\\n\\n293\\n00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000\\nAnd I would always steal it all from you.\\n\\n294\\n00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000\\nYes, she would try to.\\n\\n295\\n00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000\\nYou used to actually put his money in the bank.\\n\\n296\\n00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000\\nThe change.\\n\\n297\\n00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000\\nRemember the change?\\n\\n298\\n00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000\\nYou used to take...\\n\\n299\\n00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n300\\n00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000\\nThe change out of the containers.\\n\\n301\\n00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000\\nThat was when we had the thing for Disney.\\n\\n302\\n00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000\\nThe big door thing.\\n\\n303\\n00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000\\nWe would make everybody put the change in.\\n\\n304\\n00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000\\nIt was like our Disney money.\\n\\n305\\n00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000\\nThe kids would always put all the change they would find in there.\\n\\n306\\n00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000\\nDon't you remember that?\\n\\n307\\n00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000\\nYeah, I had my own little piggy bank, too.\\n\\n308\\n00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000\\nBut I just had my little lump of change and dollars.\\n\\n309\\n00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000\\nAnd I would always just save up.\\n\\n310\\n00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000\\nAnd I would never spend it.\\n\\n311\\n00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000\\nI just really like to save.\\n\\n312\\n00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n313\\n00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000\\nWhat, boy?\\n\\n314\\n00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000\\nI know you want to say something.\\n\\n315\\n00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000\\nYou're so cute.\\n\\n316\\n00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000\\nWhere's your friend?\\n\\n317\\n00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000\\nWhere's Spark?\\n\\n318\\n00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000\\nSpark's downstairs.\\n\\n319\\n00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000\\nLet's go get him.\\n\\n320\\n00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000\\nNo.\\n\\n321\\n00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000\\nNo.\\n\\n322\\n00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n323\\n00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n324\\n00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000\\nIs he sleeping?\\n\\n325\\n00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000\\nHe's sleeping.\\n\\n326\\n00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000\\nGio.\\n\\n327\\n00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000\\nHe's telling you no.\\n\\n328\\n00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000\\nGio.\\n\\n329\\n00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000\\nHe's telling you no.\\n\\n330\\n00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000\\nBecause you know everything.\\n\\n331\\n00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000\\nGio protects him.\\n\\n332\\n00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000\\nHe takes naps around this time because Sabrina goes out.\\n\\n333\\n00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000\\nAnd then when she comes back, he's up all night running around playing.\\n\\n334\\n00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000\\nWith Spark.\\n\\n335\\n00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000\\nI'm glad I took that light out.\\n\\n336\\n00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000\\nIt looks nice.\\n\\n337\\n00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000\\nYeah, you're missing 12 bulbs apparently, Grandma says.\\n\\n338\\n00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000\\nGrandma, I don't understand why you just don't walk down the stairs.\\n\\n339\\n00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000\\nYou've been up there the whole time.\\n\\n340\\n00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000\\nI'm comfortable right where I'm at.\\n\\n341\\n00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000\\nWell, I'll walk upstairs for you.\\n\\n342\\n00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000\\nNo, no, no.\\n\\n343\\n00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000\\nIt's okay.\\n\\n344\\n00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000\\nIt's okay.\\n\\n345\\n00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000\\nI got an idea.\\n\\n346\\n00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000\\nYo, Dad.\\n\\n347\\n00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000\\nCome here.\\n\\n348\\n00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000\\nCome here.\\n\\n349\\n00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000\\nWhere is
