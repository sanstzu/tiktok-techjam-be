one.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000\\nSo I've never done a video like this before.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000\\nI've always got suggested this.\\n\\n5\\n00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000\\nBut, like, I just didn't know if I really wanted to do it or not.\\n\\n6\\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000\\nToday, we're going to be vlogging for 15 minutes straight.\\n\\n7\\n00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000\\nWithout any cuts.\\n\\n8\\n00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000\\nOh, this could go very wrong.\\n\\n9\\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000\\nAnyway, I'm over at my parents' house right now.\\n\\n10\\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000\\nLet's go inside and see what's up with everybody.\\n\\n11\\n00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000\\nOh yeah, not only is there no cuts, but there's, like, no edits either.\\n\\n12\\n00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000\\nThis is just, like, the rawest form of video I have ever posted in my life.\\n\\n13\\n00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000\\nBut let's go say what up.\\n\\n14\\n00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000\\nHello.\\n\\n15\\n00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000\\nOh!\\n\\n16\\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000\\nYou got me!\\n\\n17\\n00:00:45,000 -->

there?\\n\\n35\\n00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000\\nWow.\\n\\n36\\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000\\nYou paid that specific bill?\\n\\n37\\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000\\nYeah.\\n\\n38\\n00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000\\nOh, gosh.\\n\\n39\\n00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000\\nWe're all goofs in here.\\n\\n40\\n00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000\\nMissing bulbs.\\n\\n41\\n00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n42\\n00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000\\nGirl, they're all in.\\n\\n43\\n00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000\\nYeah, there was never.\\n\\n44\\n00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000\\nI'm so confused.\\n\\n45\\n00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000\\nWe're so confused.\\n\\n46\\n00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000\\nThere was bulbs missing earlier.\\n\\n47\\n00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000\\nThere was not.\\n\\n48\\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000\\nYes, there was.\\n\\n49\\n00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000\\nWe had bulbs yesterday.\\n\\n50\\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000\\nIt was done.\\n\\n51\\n00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000\\nIt was not.\\n\\n52\\n00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000\\nYou're a liar.\\n\\n53\\n00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000\\nHello.\\n\\n54\\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000\\nHi.\\n\\n55\\n00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000\\nHi.\\n\\n56\\n00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000\\nOh, you're not answering that?\\n\\n57\\n00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000\\nNo, we got the 15 minutes of vlog.\\n\\n58\\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000\\nWhat do we have?\\n\\n59\\n00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000\\nWe have two minutes, people.\\n\\n60\\n00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000\\nThis is interesting.\\n\\n61\\n00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000\\nYou know what's really weird?\\n\\n62\\n00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000\\nI used to vlog all the time with absolutely no cuts.\\n\\n63\\n00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000\\nOh my gosh.\\n\\n64\\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n65\\n00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000\\nDid you throw something at me?\\n\\n66\\n00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000\\nYes, you did me.\\n\\n67\\n00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000\\nAsshole.\\n\\n68\\n00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000\\nWhat happened?\\n\\n69\\n00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000\\nWhat is it?\\n\\n70\\n00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000\\nHe threw something over the boat.\\n\\n71\\n00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000\\nWhat did you throw at me?\\n\\n72\\n00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000\\nYou're an asshole.\\n\\n73\\n00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000\\nCome on, I'm trying to find furniture.\\n\\n74\\n00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000\\nWhat are you getting now?\\n\\n75\\n00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000\\nIt's not big enough.\\n\\n76\\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000\\nOh, my mom is sending her couch back because it's not big enough.\\n\\n77\\n00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000\\nI can just take it off your hands if you want.\\n\\n78\\n00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000\\nHere, you want a boner?\\n\\n79\\n00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n80\\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000\\nYou want to buy something?\\n\\n81\\n00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000\\nHow much is it?\\n\\n82\\n00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000\\nThree.\\n\\n83\\n00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000\\nThree?\\n\\n84\\n00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000\\nThree dollars?\\n\\n85\\n00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000\\nI'm down.\\n\\n86\\n00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000\\nObviously, it's more than that.\\n\\n87\\n00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000\\nIt would look nicer in your place.\\n\\n88\\n00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000\\nIt would.\\n\\n89\\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000\\nI think it'll look really nice in that room that we have no furniture in now.\\n\\n90\\n00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000\\nI think it's phenomenal.\\n\\n91\\n00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n92\\n00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000\\nI don't get it.\\n\\n93\\n00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000\\nI don't know.\\n\\n94\\n00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000\\nI'm not really making any money right now.\\n\\n95\\n00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000\\nI got to relax on the spending.\\n\\n96\\n00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000\\nI'm going to let you go on.\\n\\n97\\n00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000\\nI spent a lot of money.\\n\\n98\\n00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000\\nI said you let her go on.\\n\\n99\\n00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000\\nI just paid the electric.\\n\\n100\\n00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000\\nI just can't cut.\\n\\n101\\n00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000\\nNo, we can't.\\n\\n102\\n00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000\\nNo cuts today.\\n\\n103\\n00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000\\nWhat are you doing?\\n\\n104\\n00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000\\nThis video is totally out of focus right now.\\n\\n105\\n00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000\\nI apologize, guys.\\n\\n106\\n00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000\\nThere's this setting on my camera, and if I tap the screen, it goes completely out of focus.\\n\\n107\\n00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000\\nObviously, I can't cut this.\\n\\n108\\n00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000\\nI can't really restart or fix it.\\n\\n109\\n00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000\\nWe're going to have to deal with a little bit of blurriness.\\n\\n110\\n00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000\\nI'm trying to fix it, though, if I can center it.\\n\\n111\\n00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000\\nI need a motorcycle fairing for my bike.\\n\\n112\\n00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000\\nA what?\\n\\n113\\n00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000\\nA motorcycle fairing on my bike.\\n\\n114\\n00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000\\nWhat is a fairing?\\n\\n115\\n00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n116\\n00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000\\nWhat are you saying?\\n\\n117\\n00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000\\nSay what?\\n\\n118\\n00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n119\\n00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000\\nFairing.\\n\\n120\\n00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000\\nWhat did you just say?\\n\\n121\\n00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000\\nMotorcycle fairing.\\n\\n122\\n00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000\\nFairing?\\n\\n123\\n00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000\\nWhat did you say?\\n\\n124\\n00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000\\nFairing?\\n\\n125\\n00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000\\nWhat is this word?\\n\\n126\\n00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000\\nIt's a windshield.\\n\\n127\\n00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000\\nA fairing.\\n\\n128\\n00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000\\nOh, fairing.\\n\\n129\\n00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000\\nI still don't know what that is.\\n\\n130\\n00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000\\nHey, father, I need a thing for this bike.\\n\\n131\\n00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000\\nGio.\\n\\n132\\n00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000\\nGio, you want to be in the vlog?\\n\\n133\\n00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000\\nYou want to be in the vlog?\\n\\n134\\n00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000\\nWhat?\\n\\n135\\n00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000\\nWhat do you want?\\n\\n136\\n00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000\\nWhat do you want?\\n\\n137\\n00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000\\nHe wants a treat, don't you?\\n\\n138\\n00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000\\nIs that what you want?\\n\\n139\\n00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000\\nOh, yeah, he's going to the closet.\\n\\n140\\n00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000\\nAll right, this dog is the pickiest dog ever.\\n\\n141\\n00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000\\nWatch this, okay?\\n\\n142\\n00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000\\nWhat kind of treat do you want, Gio?\\n\\n143\\n00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000\\nWe got...\\n\\n144\\n00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000\\nHe'll never accept any of these treats.\\n\\n145\\n00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000\\nHe's so picky.\\n\\n146\\n00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000\\nCome here.\\n\\n147\\n00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000\\nYou want this?\\n\\n148\\n00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000\\nLook, he'll smell it and he won't take it.\\n\\n149\\n00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000\\nSee?\\n\\n150\\n00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000\\nWhat is he doing?\\n\\n151\\n00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000\\nHe'll do that with every single treat.\\n\\n152\\n00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000\\nWe've learned a trick.\\n\\n153\\n00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000\\nJust give him a treat, and if he doesn't accept it, just leave it there.\\n\\n154\\n00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000\\nHe'll eventually come back and take it.\\n\\n155\\n00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000\\nOoh, what do we got over here?\\n\\n156\\n00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000\\nIs this brownies?\\n\\n157\\n00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000\\nOh, that's not a brownie.\\n\\n158\\n00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000\\nRibs.\\n\\n159\\n00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000\\nI don't know why I thought that looked like a brownie.\\n\\n160\\n00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000\\nThat's not brownies.\\n\\n161\\n00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000\\nThat's meat.\\n\\n162\\n00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000\\nSome chicken.\\n\\n163\\n00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000\\nOoh.\\n\\n164\\n00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000\\nHuh?\\n\\n165\\n00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000\\nGio, what do you think?\\n\\n166\\n00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000\\nBlack leather.\\n\\n167\\n00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000\\nBlack leather?\\n\\n168\\n00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000\\nI'm so upset because, like, this actually looks so nice.\\n\\n169\\n00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000\\nAnd it feels so comfy, too.\\n\\n170\\n00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000\\nIt's velvet.\\n\\n171\\n00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000\\nHere's
